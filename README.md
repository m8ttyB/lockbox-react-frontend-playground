# lockbox-react-frontend-playground

This is a React web app for experimenting with Lockbox UI. 
Might be useful for a quick front-end for a lockbox web extension.

For reference, a fully working redux-based web extension example is here:

Build and Run:

- `npm install; npm start`

Open localhost:3000 in your browser
